<para id="fs-id1164435923227">Many groups in U.S. history have sought recognition as equal citizens. Although each group’s efforts have been notable and important, arguably the greatest, longest, and most violent struggle was that of African Americans, whose once-inferior legal status was even written into the text of the Constitution. Their fight for freedom and equality provided the legal and moral foundation for others who sought recognition of their equality later on.</para>

<title>SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR</title>
<para id="fs-id1164435935946">In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Jefferson</term> made the radical statement that “all men are created equal” and “are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” Yet like other wealthy landowners of his time, Jefferson also owned dozens of other human beings as his personal property. He recognized this contradiction and personally considered the institution of slavery to be a “hideous blot” on the nation.<cite target-id="rf-014" id="cite-00001"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-014">Lucia Stanton. 2008. “Thomas Jefferson and Slavery,” https://www.monticello.org/site/plantation-and-slavery/thomas-jefferson-and-slavery#footnoteref3_srni04n.</note></cite> However, in order to forge a political union that would stand the test of time, he and the other founders—and later the framers of the Constitution—chose not to address the issue in any definitive way. Political support for abolition was very much a minority stance at the time, although after the Revolution many of the northern states did abolish slavery for a variety of reasons.<cite target-id="rf-015" id="cite-00002"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-015">“How Did Slavery Disappear in the North?” http://www.abolitionseminar.org/how-did-northern-states-gradually-abolish-slavery/ (April 10, 2016); Nicholas Boston and Jennifer Hallam, “The Slave Experience: Freedom and Emancipation,” http://www.pbs.org/wnet/slavery/experience/freedom/history.html (April 10, 2016).</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-id1164435743969">As the new United States expanded westward, however, the issue of slavery became harder to ignore and ignited much controversy. Many opponents of slavery were willing to accept the institution if it remained largely confined to the South but did not want it to spread westward. They feared the expansion of slavery would lead to the political dominance of the South over the North and would deprive small farmers in the newly acquired western territories who could not afford slaves.<cite target-id="rf-016" id="cite-00003"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-016">Eric Foner. 1970. <emphasis effect="italics">Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War</emphasis>. New York: Oxford University Press, 28, 50, 54.</note></cite> Abolitionists, primarily in the North, also argued that slavery was both immoral and opposed basic U.S. values; they demanded an end to it.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164435545109">The spread of slavery into the West seemed inevitable, however, following the Supreme Court’s ruling in the case <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002"><emphasis effect="italics">Dred Scott v.

Sandford</emphasis>, 60 U.S. 393 (1857).</note></cite> decided in 1857. Scott, who had been born into slavery but had spent time in free states and territories, argued that his temporary residence in a territory where slavery had been banned by the federal government had made him a free man. The Supreme Court rejected his argument. In fact, the Court’s majority stated that Scott had no legal right to sue for his freedom at all because Black people (whether free or enslaved) were not and could not become U.S. citizens. Thus, Scott lacked the standing to even appear before the court. The Court also held that Congress lacked the power to decide whether slavery would be permitted in a territory that had been acquired after the Constitution was ratified, in effect prohibiting the federal government from passing any laws that would limit the expansion of slavery into any part of the West.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164435791222">Ultimately, of course, the issue was decided by the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Civil War</term> (1861–1865), with the southern states seceding to defend their “states’ rights” to determine their own destinies without interference by the federal government. Foremost among the rights claimed by the southern states was the right to decide whether their residents would be allowed to own slaves.<cite target-id="rf-018" id="cite-00005"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-018">David M.

The first step was the issuance of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Emancipation Proclamation</term> on January 1, 1863 (<link target-id="OSC_AmGov_05_02_Emancipate"/>). Although it stated “all persons held as slaves . . . henceforward shall be free,” the proclamation was limited in effect to the states that had rebelled. Slaves in states that had remained within the Union, such as Maryland and Delaware, and in parts of the Confederacy that were already occupied by the Union army, were not set free. Although slaves in states in rebellion were technically freed, because Union troops controlled relatively small portions of these states at the time, it was impossible to ensure that enslaved people were freed in reality and not simply on paper.<cite target-id="rf-019" id="cite-00006"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-019">David Herbert Donald. 1995. <emphasis effect="italics">Lincoln</emphasis>.

<title>RECONSTRUCTION</title>
<para id="fs-id1164435923161">At the end of the Civil War, the South entered a period called <term id="term-00006">Reconstruction</term> (1865–1877) during which state governments were reorganized before the rebellious states were allowed to be readmitted to the Union. As part of this process, the Republican Party pushed for a permanent end to slavery. A constitutional amendment to this effect was passed by the House of Representatives in January 1865, after having already been approved by the Senate in April 1864, and it was ratified in December 1865 as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Thirteenth Amendment</term>. The amendment’s first section states, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” In effect, this amendment outlawed slavery in the United States.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164435731841">The changes wrought by the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Fourteenth Amendment</term> were more extensive. In addition to introducing the equal protection clause to the Constitution, this amendment also extended the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the states, required the states to respect the privileges or immunities of all citizens, and, for the first time, defined citizenship at the national and state levels. People could no longer be excluded from citizenship based solely on their race. Although some of these provisions were rendered mostly toothless by the courts or the lack of political action to enforce them, others were pivotal in the expansion of civil rights.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164435571316">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Fifteenth Amendment</term> stated that people could not be denied the right to vote based on “race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” This construction allowed states to continue to decide the qualifications of voters as long as those qualifications were ostensibly race-neutral. Thus, while states could not deny African American men the right to vote on the basis of race, they could deny it to women on the basis of sex or to people who could not prove they were literate.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164435655893">Although the immediate effect of these provisions was quite profound, over time the Republicans in Congress gradually lost interest in pursuing Reconstruction policies, and the Reconstruction ended with the end of military rule in the South and the withdrawal of the Union army in 1877.<cite target-id="rf-020" id="cite-00007"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-020">Erik Foner. 1988. <emphasis effect="italics">Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877</emphasis>.

New York: Basic Books, 105–106.</note></cite> The revocation of voting rights, or <term id="term-00010">disenfranchisement</term>, took a number of forms; not every southern state used the same methods, and some states used more than one, but they all disproportionately affected Black voter registration and turnout.<cite target-id="rf-022" id="cite-00009"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-022">Keyssar, 114–115.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-id1164435570188">Perhaps the most famous of the tools of disenfranchisement were <term id="term-00011">literacy tests</term> and <term id="term-00012">understanding tests</term>. Literacy tests, which had been used in the North since the 1850s to disqualify naturalized European immigrants from voting, called on the prospective voter to demonstrate his (and later her) ability to read a particular passage of text. However, since voter registration officials had discretion to decide what text the voter was to read, they could give easy passages to voters they wanted to register (typically White people) and more difficult passages to those whose registration they wanted to deny (typically Black people). Understanding tests required the prospective voter to explain the <emphasis effect="italics">meaning</emphasis> of a particular passage of text, often a provision of the U.S. Constitution, or answer a series of questions related to citizenship. Again, since the official examining the prospective voter could decide which passage or questions to choose, the difficulty of the test might vary dramatically between White and Black applicants.<cite target-id="rf-023" id="cite-00010"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-023">Keyssar, 111–112.</note></cite> Even had these tests been administered fairly and equitably, however, most Black people would have been at a huge disadvantage, because few could read. Although schools for Black people had existed in some places, southern states had made it largely illegal to teach slaves to read and write. At the beginning of the Civil War, only 5 percent of Black people could read and write, and most of them lived in the North.<cite target-id="rf-024" id="cite-00011"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-024">Kimberly Sambol-Tosco, “The Slave Experience: Education, Arts, and Culture,” http://www.pbs.org/wnet/slavery/experience/education/history2.html (April 10, 2016).</note></cite> Some were able to take advantage of educational opportunities after they were freed, but many were not able to gain effective literacy.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164435850702">In some states, poorer, less literate White voters feared being disenfranchised by the literacy and understanding tests. Some states introduced a loophole, known as the <term id="term-00013">grandfather clause</term>, to allow less literate White people to vote. The grandfather clause exempted those who had been allowed to vote in that state prior to the Civil War and their descendants from literacy and understanding tests.<cite target-id="rf-025" id="cite-00012"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-025">Keyssar, 112.</note></cite> Because Black people were not allowed to vote prior to the Civil War, but most White men had been voting at a time when there were no literacy tests, this loophole allowed most illiterate White people to vote (<link target-id="OSC_AmGov_05_02_Literacy"/>) while leaving obstacles in place for Black people who wanted to vote as well. Time limits were often placed on these provisions because state legislators realized that they might quickly be declared unconstitutional, but they lasted long enough to allow illiterate White men to register to vote.<cite target-id="rf-026" id="cite-00013"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-026">Alan Greenblat, “The Racial History of the ‘Grandfather Clause,” <emphasis effect="italics">NPR Code Switch</emphasis>, 22 October 2013. http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/21/239081586/the-racial-history-of-the-grandfather-clause.</note></cite></para>

<para id="fs-id1164435659098">In states where the voting rights of poor White people were less of a concern, another tool for disenfranchisement was the <term id="term-00014">poll tax</term> (<link target-id="OSC_AmGov_05_02_PollTax"/>). This was an annual per-person tax, typically one or two dollars (on the order of $20 to $50 today), that a person had to pay to register to vote. People who didn’t want to vote didn’t have to pay, but in several states the poll tax was cumulative, so if you decided to vote you would have to pay not only the tax due for that year but any poll tax from previous years as well. Because former slaves were usually quite poor, they were less likely than White men to be able to pay poll taxes.<cite target-id="rf-027" id="cite-00014"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-027">Keyssar, 111.</note></cite></para>

<para id="fs-id1164435909469">Although these methods were usually sufficient to ensure that Black people were kept away from the polls, some dedicated African Americans did manage to register to vote despite the obstacles placed in their way. To ensure their vote was largely meaningless, the White elites used their control of the Democratic Party to create the <term id="term-00015">White primary</term>: primary elections in which only White people were allowed to vote. The state party organizations argued that as private groups, rather than part of the state government, they had no obligation to follow the Fifteenth Amendment’s requirement not to deny the right to vote on the basis of race. Furthermore, they contended, voting for nominees to run for office was not the same as electing those who would actually hold office. So they held primary elections to choose the Democratic nominee in which only White citizens were allowed to vote.<cite target-id="rf-028" id="cite-00015"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-028">Keyssar, 247.</note></cite> Once the nominee had been chosen, he or she might face token opposition from a Republican or minor-party candidate in the general election, but since White voters had agreed beforehand to support whoever won the Democrats’ primary, the outcome of the general election was a foregone conclusion.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164435544303">With Black people effectively disenfranchised, the restored southern state governments undermined guarantees of equal treatment in the Fourteenth Amendment. They passed laws that excluded African Americans from juries and allowed the imprisonment and forced labor of “idle” Black citizens. The laws also called for segregation of White and Black people in public places under the doctrine known as “separate but equal.” As long as nominally equal facilities were provided for both White and Black people, it was legal to require members of each race to use the facilities designated for them. Similarly, state and local governments passed laws limiting what neighborhoods Black and White people could live in. Collectively, these discriminatory laws came to be known as <term id="term-00016">Jim Crow laws</term>. The Supreme Court upheld the separate but equal doctrine in 1896 in <term id="term-00017"><emphasis effect="italics">Plessy v. Ferguson</emphasis></term>, inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause, and allowed segregation to continue.<cite target-id="rf-029" id="cite-00016"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-029"><emphasis effect="italics">Plessy v.

<title>CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE COURTS</title>
<para id="fs-id1164435654757">By the turn of the twentieth century, the position of African Americans was quite bleak. Even outside the South, racial inequality was a fact of everyday life. African American leaders and thinkers themselves disagreed on the right path forward. Some, like Booker T. Washington, argued that acceptance of inequality and segregation over the short term would allow African Americans to focus their efforts on improving their educational and social status until White people were forced to acknowledge them as equals. W. E. B. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Du Bois</term>, however, argued for a more confrontational approach and in 1909 founded the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</term> (NAACP) as a rallying point for securing equality. White liberals dominated the organization in its early years, but African Americans assumed control over its operations in the 1920s.<cite target-id="rf-030" id="cite-00017"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-030">“NAACP: 100 Years of History,” https://donate.naacp.org/pages/naacp-history (April 10, 2016).</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-id1164435606810">The NAACP soon focused on a strategy of overturning Jim Crow laws through the courts. Perhaps its greatest series of legal successes consisted of its efforts to challenge segregation in education. Early cases brought by the NAACP dealt with racial discrimination in higher education. In 1938, the Supreme Court essentially gave states a choice: they could either integrate institutions of higher education, or they could establish an equivalent university or college for African Americans.<cite target-id="rf-031" id="cite-00018"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-031"><emphasis effect="italics">Missouri ex rel.

Even with the same funding and equivalent facilities, a segregated school could not have the same teachers or environment as the equivalent school for another race. The court also rested its decision in part on social science studies suggesting that racial discrimination led to feelings of inferiority among African American children. The only way to dispel this sense of inferiority was to end segregation and integrate public schools. </para>
<para id="fs-id1164435647703">It is safe to say this ruling was controversial. While integration of public schools took place without much incident in some areas of the South, particularly where there were few Black students, elsewhere it was often confrontational—or nonexistent. In recognition of the fact that southern states would delay school integration for as long as possible, civil rights activists urged the federal government to enforce the Supreme Court’s decision.

<para id="fs-id1164435932177">Beyond these favorable court rulings, however, progress toward equality for African Americans remained slow in the 1950s. In 1962, Congress proposed what later became the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Twenty-Fourth Amendment</term>, which banned the poll tax in elections to federal (but not state or local) office; the amendment went into effect after being ratified in early 1964. Several southern states continued to require residents to pay poll taxes in order to vote in state elections until 1966 when, in the case of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030"><emphasis effect="italics">Harper v.

<para id="fs-id1164435577507">The slow rate of progress led to frustration within the African American community. Newer, grassroots organizations such as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</term> (SCLC), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">Congress of Racial Equality</term> (CORE), and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee</term> (SNCC) challenged the NAACP’s position as the leading civil rights organization and questioned its legal-focused strategy. These newer groups tended to prefer more confrontational approaches, including the use of <term id="term-00034">direct action</term> campaigns relying on marches and demonstrations. The strategies of nonviolent resistance and <term id="term-00035">civil disobedience</term>, or the refusal to obey an unjust law, had been effective in the campaign led by Mahatma <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">Gandhi</term> to liberate colonial India from British rule in the 1930s and 1940s. Civil rights pioneers adopted these measures in the 1955–1956 Montgomery bus boycott. After Rosa <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">Parks</term> refused to give up her bus seat to a White person and was arrested, a group of Black women carried out a day-long boycott of Montgomery’s public transit system. This boycott was then extended for over a year and overseen by union organizer E. D. Nixon. The effort desegregated public transportation in that city.<cite target-id="rf-041" id="cite-00028"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-041">“Gandhi, Mohandas Karamchand (1869–1948),” http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_gandhi_mohandas_karamchand_1869_1948/index.html (April 10, 2016); “Nixon, E.

Not only did the act outlaw government discrimination and the unequal application of voting qualifications by race, but it also, for the first time, outlawed segregation and other forms of discrimination by most businesses that were open to the public, including hotels, theaters, and restaurants that were not private clubs. It outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, or national origin by most employers, and it created the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</term> (EEOC) to monitor employment discrimination claims and help enforce this provision of the law.

<para id="fs-id1164435710310">Even though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had a monumental impact over the long term, it did not end efforts by many southern White people to maintain the White-dominated political power structure in the region. Progress in registering African American voters remained slow in many states despite increased federal activity supporting it, so civil rights leaders including Martin Luther <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">King</term>, Jr. decided to draw the public eye to the area where the greatest resistance to voter registration drives were taking place. The SCLC and SNCC particularly focused their attention on the city of Selma, Alabama, which had been the site of violent reactions against civil rights activities.</para>

Their first attempt to march was violently broken up by state police and sheriff’s deputies (<link target-id="OSC_AmGov_05_02_Selma"/>). The second attempt was aborted because King feared it would lead to a brutal confrontation with police and violate a court order from a federal judge who had been sympathetic to the movement in the past. That night, three of the marchers, White ministers from the north, were attacked and beaten with clubs by members of the Ku Klux Klan; one of the victims died from his injuries. Televised images of the brutality against protesters and the death of a minister led to greater public sympathy for the cause. Eventually, a third march was successful in reaching the state capital of Montgomery.<cite target-id="rf-045" id="cite-00032"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-045">See David Garrow. 1978. <emphasis effect="italics">Protest at Selma</emphasis>.

This movement espouses White supremacy and does not shrink from the threat or use of violence to achieve it. Such violence occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, when various White supremacist groups and alt-right forces joined together in a "Unite the Right" rally (<link target-id="OSC_AmGov_05_03_WhiteSup"/>). This rally included chants and racial slurs against African Americans and Jews. Those rallying clashed with counter-protestors, one of whom died when an avowed Neo-Nazi deliberately drove his car into a group of peaceful protestors. He has since been convicted and sentenced to life in prison for his actions. This event sent troubling shockwaves through U.S. politics, as leaders tried to grapple with the significance of the event.

<title>Affirmative Action</title>
<para id="fs-id1164435925434">One of the major controversies regarding race in the United States today is related to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">affirmative action</term>, the practice of ensuring that members of historically disadvantaged or underrepresented groups have equal access to opportunities in education, the workplace, and government contracting. The phrase <emphasis effect="italics">affirmative action</emphasis> originated in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 11246, and it has drawn controversy ever since. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination in employment, and Executive Order 11246, issued in 1965, forbade employment discrimination not only within the federal government but by federal contractors and contractors and subcontractors who received government funds. </para>

<para id="fs-id1164435611536">Following the Civil War and the freeing of all slaves by the Thirteenth Amendment, a Republican Congress hoped to protect the freedmen from vengeful southern White people by passing the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, granting them citizenship and guaranteeing equal protection under the law and the right to vote (for Black men). The end of Reconstruction, however, allowed White Southerners to regain control of the South’s political and legal system and institute openly discriminatory Jim Crow laws. While some early efforts to secure civil rights were successful, the greatest gains came after World War II. Through a combination of lawsuits, Congressional acts, and direct action (such as President Truman’s executive order to desegregate the U.S. military), African Americans regained their voting rights and were guaranteed protection against discrimination in employment. Schools and public accommodations were desegregated. While much has been achieved, the struggle for equal treatment continues. </para>
